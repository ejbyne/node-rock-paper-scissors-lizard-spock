# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (Node.js)

## Summary

In Week 7 at Makers Academy we studied Node.js. This was my second exercise at playing around with a Node.js server, when I converted my [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://github.com/ejbyne/js-rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock) game from a Sinatra server to Node.

I also added Grunt to automate testing my Javascript code with Jasmine.
